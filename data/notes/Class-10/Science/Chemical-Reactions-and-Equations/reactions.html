<h1>What is a Chemical Reaction?</h1>

<p>
In our daily life, we observe many changes happening around us. Some changes are temporary,
while others lead to the formation of new substances.
When a change results in the formation of one or more new substances, it is called a
<strong>chemical reaction</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Daily Life Examples</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Milk turning sour when kept at room temperature</li>
  <li>Rusting of an iron nail in moist air</li>
  <li>Cooking of food</li>
  <li>Digestion of food in our body</li>
  <li>Respiration</li>
</ul>

<p>
In all these cases, the original substance changes into a new substance with different
properties. This indicates that a chemical reaction has taken place.
</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>
A <strong>chemical reaction</strong> is a process in which one or more substances
(reactants) are transformed into new substances (products).
</p>

<h2>Simple Example</h2>
<p>
When magnesium ribbon is burned in air, it reacts with oxygen to form magnesium oxide.
</p>

<h3>Word Representation</h3>
<p>
Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium Oxide
</p>

<h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Chemical reactions form new substances</li>
  <li>The properties of products are different from reactants</li>
  <li>Chemical reactions are part of everyday life</li>
</ul>
