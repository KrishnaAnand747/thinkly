<h1>Acids, Bases and Salts</h1>

<p>
Substances like lemon juice and vinegar taste sour due to acids, while soap and baking soda are basic in nature.
Acids and bases neutralise each other and play an important role in daily life.

<h2>Indicators</h2>
<p>
Indicators help us identify whether a substance is acidic or basic without tasting.
Litmus, turmeric, methyl orange and phenolphthalein are commonly used indicators.
