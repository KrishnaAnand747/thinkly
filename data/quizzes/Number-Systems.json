    "q": "Which of the following is an irrational number?",
    "options": ["√4", "3.14", "√7", "22/7"],
    "a": "√7",
    "explanation": "√4 = 2 (rational). 3.14 is a terminating decimal. 22/7 is a fraction. √7 is a non-terminating, non-recurring decimal, making it irrational."

    "q": "The value of 0.333... in the form p/q is:",
    "options": ["1/3", "3/10", "33/100", "1/9"],
    "a": "1/3",
    "explanation": "Let x = 0.333... Multiplying by 10 gives 10x = 3.333... Subtracting x gives 9x = 3, so x = 3/9 = 1/3."

    "q": "Between two rational numbers, there are:",
    "options": ["Exactly one rational number", "Exactly two rational numbers", "Infinitely many rational numbers", "No rational number"],
    "a": "Infinitely many rational numbers",
    "explanation": "A key property of the real number system is that between any two rational numbers, there are infinite rational and irrational numbers."

    "q": "The product of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number is:",
    "options": ["Always rational", "Always irrational", "Always an integer", "Sometimes rational"],
    "a": "Always irrational",
    "explanation": "The product of any non-zero rational number and an irrational number results in an irrational number."

    "q": "What is the value of (3 + √3)(3 - √3)?",
    "options": ["6", "9", "3", "0"],
    "a": "6",
    "explanation": "Using the identity (a+b)(a-b) = a² - b², we get (3)² - (√3)² = 9 - 3 = 6."

  {
    "q": "The decimal expansion of an irrational number is always:",
    "options": ["Terminating", "Non-terminating recurring", "Non-terminating non-recurring", "Terminating recurring"],
    "a": "Non-terminating non-recurring",
    "explanation": "This is the definition of an irrational number. If it were terminating or recurring, it would be rational."

    "options": ["3", "3.14", "Non-terminating", "1.414"],
    "a": "3",
    "explanation": "9 is a perfect square, so √9 = 3, which is a rational number."

    "options": ["√7 - 2", "√7 + 2", "7", "√7"],

    "options": ["32", "16", "8", "4"],
    "a": "8",
    "explanation": "64 can be written as 8². Thus, (8²)^(1/2) = 8^(2 * 1/2) = 8^1 = 8."

    "options": ["0", "1", "2", "9/5"],
    "a": "2",
    "explanation": "Any non-zero number raised to the power 0 is 1. So, (1 + 1) / 1 = 2 / 1 = 2."
