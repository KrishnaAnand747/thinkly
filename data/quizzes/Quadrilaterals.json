    "options": ["180°", "270°", "360°", "540°"],
    "a": "360°",
    "explanation": "According to the Angle Sum Property of a quadrilateral, the sum of internal angles is always 360°."

    "a": "Parallelogram",
    "explanation": "By definition, a parallelogram is a quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel."

    "q": "If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other at right angles, then it is a:",
    "options": ["Rectangle", "Trapezium", "Rhombus", "Parallelogram"],
    "a": "Rhombus",
    "explanation": "While all parallelograms have diagonals that bisect each other, only in a Rhombus (and Square) do they bisect at 90°."

    "a": "All of the above",
    "explanation": "A square satisfies all properties of a rectangle (90° angles), a rhombus (equal sides), and a parallelogram (parallel sides)."

    "a": "Both A and B",
    "explanation": "This is the Mid-point Theorem: it states the segment is parallel to and half the length of the third side."
