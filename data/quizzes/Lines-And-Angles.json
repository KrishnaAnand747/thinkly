    "q": "If two lines intersect, the vertically opposite angles are always:",

    "q": "An angle which is greater than 180° but less than 360° is called:",
    "options": ["Acute angle", "Obtuse angle", "Straight angle", "Reflex angle"],
    "a": "Reflex angle",
    "explanation": "By definition, a reflex angle lies between 180 and 360 degrees."

    "q": "If two complementary angles are in the ratio 2:3, then the angles are:",
    "options": ["36°, 54°", "40°, 50°", "20°, 30°", "45°, 45°"],
    "a": "36°, 54°",
    "explanation": "2x + 3x = 90 => 5x = 90 => x = 18. The angles are 2(18)=36 and 3(18)=54."

    "explanation": "Consecutive interior angles (co-interior) between parallel lines sum up to 180°."
