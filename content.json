      "Section B (Very Short, 2 Marks)": [
        { "q": "Why should a magnesium ribbon be cleaned before burning in air?", "a": "Magnesium ribbon forms a layer of magnesium oxide on its surface due to reaction with oxygen in the air. This layer is quite stable and prevents further reaction of magnesium. It must be cleaned using sandpaper to expose the pure metal." },

      "Section C (Short Answer, 3 Marks)": [
        { "q": "Explain the terms oxidation and reduction in terms of electron transfer, giving one example.", "a": "Oxidation is the loss of electrons (OIL), and reduction is the gain of electrons (RIG). For example, in the reaction $Zn + Cu^{2+} \\to Zn^{2+} + Cu$, Zinc is oxidized and Copper ion is reduced." }

        { "q": "Describe the five main types of chemical reactions with a balanced equation for each.", "a": "The five types are: 1. Combination, 2. Decomposition, 3. Displacement, 4. Double Displacement, 5. Redox. The description should include defining characteristics and the state of reactants/products." }
